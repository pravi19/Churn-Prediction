Churn prediction is predicting which customers are at high risk of leaving your company or canceling a subscription to a service, based on their behavior with your product. 


This Churn prediction model is build using ANN Model.Artificial Neural Network(ANN) uses the processing of the brain as a basis to develop algorithms that can be used to model complex patterns and prediction problems.

Libraries used:-Pandas,numpy,sklearn,tensorflow and keras 


Data used:


Steps used in building the model

a)Data preprocessing stage

1) Import necessary libraries for data processing and ANN.Using this import csv file using pandas library.
2)Encoding categorical data to continuous data using Label and OneHotEncoding techniques 
3) Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set.
4) Feature scaling to maintain uniform scale across the data set.


b)Training the model with ANN

1)Initializing the ANN and creating first and second hidden layer with relu activation function
2)Creating output layer with sigmoid function
3)Compiling and predicting the output using confusion matrix and accuracy score
